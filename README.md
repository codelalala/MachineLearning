# MachineLearning
For Decision Tree, i'm still not sure how to build trees on python
For logistic regression, i'm not sure about the signs of gradient and from the loss function how to reverse back to the actual code of update weight







Need to search:
list, array, set, dic
array*array is ok, but mat*mat is not?

Need to learn sklearn
